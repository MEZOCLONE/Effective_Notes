# Effective Notes
This app is just a showcase for my Android Development skills, no pull request will be accepted. However, if you ever want to fork the project I warmly thank you to think that this code is valid as a base for your own.


I am using the the Github issue tracker from Day 1 as my scrum board in order havea common place for bug, feature enhancements and so on. In addition, it allows me tokeep track of what's in a milestone and what's not. Therefore, If you have any suggestion about a feature or you have any issue, please use the issue tracker.

Thank you so much for reading this.
